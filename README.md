# supit_webApp

This is mostly static website with some dynamic functionalities made in JavaScript. This was my first encounter with web development, so whole application is very simple. The goal was to learn HTML, CSS and basics of JavaScript. It was a project assignment from college.

In demo folder, you can find demo material in order to see finished application.
